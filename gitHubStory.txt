Mikey was a frog. He was a friendly frog, however Mikey was completely hideous.
So much so that he found it impossible to make any friends. One day, Mikey was 
sitting by the edge of his favorite pond when a small trout visited him at the
bank. Mikey got in the water to say hello to the trout, and was pleasantly 
surprised when the trout did not swim away! The trout introduced himself as Jimmy, 
and after a thorough conversation, they discovered they both shared a passion for
Competitive Underwater Knitting!

Turns out, both Jimmy and Mikey started Competitive Underwater Knitting at a young 
age. From that day on, Jimmy and Mikey practiced underwater knitting every single
day and built a strong friendship. They ate together, swam together, and taught 
each other special tricks to improve their underwater knitting. Mikey was the 
happiest he had ever been because he had made a friend. However, one day, Mikey's
family told him that his family had to move to a different pond. (Crescentia)

Mikey was heart broken, what could he do without his best friend? Who would he do his
knitting with?He wanted Jimmy to come with him so badly but he know it wasn't possible, 
Jimmy couldn't breathe air or walk! When it was time to go Mikey and Jimmy said their 
goodbyes, and expected to never see each other again. Jimmy was determined to find Mikey's
new home, he knew many of the ponds ware connected by small swimmable ravines. Jimmy began 
searching as  soon as  Mikey left and so did Mikey but they didn't found each other. Years
passed but Mikey and Jimmy neveer forget their friendship. As old men they reconnected at a mutual 
friends family reunion and reminsced about their younger days. (Gabe)
