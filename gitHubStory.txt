Mikey was a frog. He was a friendly frog, however Mikey was completely hideous.
So much so that he found it impossible to make any friends. One day, Mikey was 
sitting by the edge of his favorite pond when a small trout visited him at the
bank. Mikey got in the water to say hello to the trout, and was pleasantly 
surprised when the trout did not swim away! The trout introduced himself as Jimmy, 
and after a thorough conversation, they discovered they both shared a passion for
Competitive Underwater Knitting!
Turns out, both Jimmy and Mikey started Competitive Underwater Knitting at a young 
age. From that day on, Jimmy and Mikey practiced underwater knitting every single
day and built a strong friendship. They ate together, swam together, and taught 
each other special tricks to improve their underwater knitting. Mikey was the 
happiest he had ever been because he had made a friend. However, one day, Mikey's
family told him that his family had to move to a different pond.
